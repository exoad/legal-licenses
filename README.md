# legal-licenses
templates for the licenses i use with my projects

# my primary

for most of my side projects (not based on 3rd party contribution size and mostly based on my own dedication), projects are licensed under `BSD-4`; however, some can be licensed under
`BSD-3`

# my own 

i also have my own set of licenses i create and use ("crayon licenses") for more official projects. there are currently two types:

1. permissive
these are similar to the `BSD` and `MIT` licenses but there are additional clauses to protect my work and my recognition

`1.0` - https://github.com/Halcyoninae/SPH-License 

2. protective, restrictive
these are not similar to any licenses and most of them focus on making sure my rights are maintained without maintaining the end user. they are aimed to be as restrictive to work with for the end user as possible if they are especially not for private use be it educational, governmental, or commercial.

`1.0` - https://github.com/Halcyoninae/HP-License
